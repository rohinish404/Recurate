# Live Reload

While working with this project i use `serve` command from terminal to run the html file on localhost but it doesn't come with live reload so i wrote a custom live reload script which can detect everytime any file changes and then reloads the html script running on localhost.

The main file is `watcher.js` which is present in the src/.

## How to use?

```
node src/watcher.js
```
